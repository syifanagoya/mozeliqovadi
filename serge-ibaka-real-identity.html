Amadou Djonga and Desiree Ibaka, his parents, were both basketball players. He was born in Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo, on September 18, 1989. In the 2008 NBA Draft, Ibaka was the 24th overall pick.</p><p>In terms of love, Ibaka was seriously dating singer/actress Keri Hilson, but the couple split up after four years. They dated from 2012 to 2016, and Ibaka is currently dating South African actress Pearl Thusi.</p><p>Ranie Ibaka, the Clippers star’s daughter, was born when he was only 17 years old. He is said to have raised her as a single father, as little is known about her biological mother.</p><p>Basketball player Serge Ibaka is his true self, not an alter ego. Ibaka is an NBA player for the Milwaukee Bucks.</p><p>Serge is a basketball player for the Spanish national team. In the 2008 NBA draught, he was selected by the Seattle SuperSonics with the 24th overall pick.</p><p>Serge has also been named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team three times. He has also led the league in blocks a few times. Similarly, as a key member of the Toronto Raptors in 2019, he won his first NBA championship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Serge-Ibaka-3-300x169.webp><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kevin Ollie (UConn Coach) Have Two Children With His Ex-Wife Stephanie</a></strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=NBA_Career_of_Serge_Ibaka></span>NBA Career of Serge Ibaka<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ibaka debuted in the NBA in 2009 and had a successful rookie season. Despite limited playing time, he averaged 6.3 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks per game. His physicality was a huge plus on the court, and the Sonics made him a valuable starter, which increased his numbers.</p><p>Ibaka established his defensive dominance in the league quickly. He led the NBA in blocks for two consecutive seasons (2012, 2013), and he was named to the All-Defensive First Team from 2012 to 2014.</p><p>After eight seasons with the Thunder, including a trip to the NBA Finals in 2012, Ibaka was traded to the Orlando Magic.</p><p>Ibaka’s time with the Magic was brief, as he was traded less than a year after arriving. In 2017, he was traded to the Toronto Raptors by the franchise.</p><p>The Congolese player fit in well with the Raptors’ system, posting six consecutive triple-doubles in early 2019. The same year, Ibaka averaged 15.0 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 2.9 blocks per game in the regular season, leading the Raptors to their first championship.</p><p>Ibaka became a free agent after the 2019/20 season and chose to sign with the Los Angeles Clippers rather than sign an extension with Toronto. He was a valuable contributor for the Clippers, starting the majority of the games in which he appeared. Unfortunately, multiple injury issues prevented him and the team from progressing beyond the Western Conference Finals in the 2021 playoffs.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener nofollow">A post shared by Serge Ibaka (@sergeibaka)</a></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth_and_Endorsements_Of_Serge_Ibaka_2021></span>Net Worth and Endorsements Of Serge Ibaka 2021<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Serge Ibaka has an estimated net worth of $12 million.

Samuel Soba was a fictitious name.</p><p>Ibaka, Serge Jonas Serge Ibaka’s given name was Ngobila when he was born.</p><p>Aside from Ibaka’s real-life motivational story, there have been a few rumours about Serge. Serge was in a four-year relationship with Keri Hilson when a strange conspiracy led to unresolved talks.</p><p>Andy Hoops, a YouTube channel, first brought the conspiracy to the public’s attention when Serge Ibaka was mistaken for his real name, Samuel Soba, and also lied about his age.</p><p>However, another channel called Ball Talk helped to clear up some of the confusion. As a result, the channel concluded that all of this false information came from a website called Bio articles.</p><p>There is no such thing as a Samuel Soba or a Jayden. And Keri Hilson did not marry in 2002, and her only connection to Serge is their four-year relationship. Also, because of the hoax created by the bio article and other related articles, the name Samuel Soba appears on Google.</p><p>Aside from that, Ibaka has a daughter who was born after Serge left Congo. Her mother and Ibaka’s father look after her. And, intriguingly, they first met when her daughter was five years old.

Désiré’s father decided to move the family to Ouesso, in the country’s northwest corner, to get away from the gunfire.</p><p>In this small town in the middle of the forest on the border with Cameroon, there was no easy access to water, and electricity was also intermittent.</p><p>Serge, on the other hand, was a hard worker who quickly adjusted to the situation and focused his entire effort on school and basketball.</p><p>His uncle, who was already in the Tours region of France, helped bring him over to try out for some clubs in Paris and the rest of France.
