You’re going to win some and you’re gonna lose a lot. But the real victory is in never giving up and going the distance for yourself, your loved ones, and standing at the top of these steps you’re reminded that all things are possible. Keep punching.”</p><p>The “Rocky” film series, starting with its first installment made on a modest budget and shot in just 28 days, went on to become a global phenomenon.</p><p>The success of the film, both critically and at the box office, underscored the universal appeal of the underdog story. Stallone’s character, Rocky Balboa, has since become a symbol of determination and hope, resonating with audiences worldwide.</p><p>As Stallone’s character famously said, <strong>“It ain’t about how hard you hit; it’s about how hard you can get hit and keep <a href=# title=Moving rel=noopener>moving</a> forward.”</strong> This message, embodied by both Rocky and the city of Philadelphia, remains a powerful reminder of the resilience and strength of the human spirit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilqam1qMXAmqVnm5%2BifKq60qKbnmWgnbatuNisZJ%2BhoqjBbrHVnqlmqp%2BYuLp5w5qwaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-phillys-first-ever-rocky-day.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finside-phillys-first-ever-rocky-day.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finside-phillys-first-ever-rocky-day.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finside-phillys-first-ever-rocky-day.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-phillys-first-ever-rocky-day.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-phillys-first-ever-rocky-day.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./anastasia-klimko-matthaus.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./anastasia-klimko-matthaus.html>Who is Anastasia Klimko Matthus?
