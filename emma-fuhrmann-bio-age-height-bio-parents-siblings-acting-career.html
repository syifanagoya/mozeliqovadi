She has been on that list ever since and is a strong supporter of the Alzheimer’s Association.&nbsp;Fuhrmann is also a strong supporter of a California-based sanctuary for abused animals known as The Gentle Barn and the Humane Society of the United States of America.</span></p><p><span>Her philanthropic nature has led her to always give back to the communities where she shoots her films.&nbsp;While on location for The Magic of Belle Isle, she supported The Food Pantry in Greenwood Lake, New York.&nbsp;Emma Fuhrmann has also donated to Grace Help Center, an orphanage in Rustenburg, South Africa.&nbsp;This orphanage was very close to where Blended was shot.</span></p><p>She does charity work at Cook Children’s Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, where she helps care for cancer patients.&nbsp;<span>Far from comedy and philanthropy, she is very sporty and athletic.&nbsp;She swims with a swim team in the summer and skis the slopes in the winter.</span></p><p><span>The actress also has a passion for fashion andclothing design.&nbsp;She even dreams of having her own clothing line in the future.&nbsp;As part of her action plan to actualize this, in July 2013 she

career</span></b></h2><p><span>Emma stepped into the limelight early in life when she was signed by the Kim Dawson Agency in Dallas as a model at just 18 months old.&nbsp;While at the agency, she was used for print campaigns by major brands such as AAFES, Belk, Dillards, JCPenney, Neiman Marcus, T-Mobile and many other brands.</span></p><p><span>She had her first acting audition at the age of 5 and I got there.&nbsp;The audition was for the Dallas Morning News Commercial.&nbsp;After this commercial, Emma Fuhrmann did further commercials for Heart to Heart Dolls, Subway, The Great Wolf Lodge and TXU Energy.</span></p><p>After doing commercials, she moved on to television series.&nbsp;Fuhrmann starred as Sissy Peele in the pilot episode of&nbsp;<i><span>Chase</span></i><span>, the NBC/BRUCKHEIMER soap opera.&nbsp;The next film she starred in,&nbsp;</span><i><span>Are We Listening</span></i><span>, won her a Gideon Film Festival Award for Best Actress.&nbsp;This was quickly followed by her role as Amanda Patterson, the only witness to her parents’ murder, on an episode of NBC’s&nbsp;</span><i><span>Principal Suspect.</span></i></p><p><span>The big hit for her came when she was cast alongside Morgan Freeman and Virginia Madsen in&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Magic of Belle Isle</span></i><span>.&nbsp;This preceded another film that earned its starring role and an award nomination, Blended.&nbsp;She has also starred in movies like&nbsp;</span><i><span>Lost in the Sun (2015)</span></i></p><h2><b><span>His family: parents and siblings</span></b></h2><p><span>Emma

been touted to be linked to Mark Fuhrman, the former LAPD detective famous for the huge role he played in the investigation of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman in the notorious OJ Murder Case of Simpsons.&nbsp;However, she said that although she has an uncle who goes by the name Mark, she is not related to the former detective.&nbsp;She further clarified that she has an extra ‘n’ that differentiates her last name from Mark’s.</span></p><p>Traces her maternal and paternal lineage, she is multi-ethnic German, English, Luxembourgish and Irish.</p><p class=postsid
