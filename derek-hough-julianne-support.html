Hough and Erbert were at the Washington, D.C. stop of their&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Symphony of Dance</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;tour when Erbert “became disorientated and was taken to the hospital,” as Hough revealed on&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Instagram</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;on Dec. 7, 2023.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She was eventually diagnosed with a cranial hematoma — when blood collects in the skull — from a burst blood vessel. A few weeks later, she&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>underwent a second surgery</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, which went successfully and marked a significant milestone in the dancer’s recovery.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hough told the magazine that his parents and siblings, which include Sharee, Marabeth, Katherine, and Julianne, were on a “rotation” of sorts as they cared for Erbert and Hough himself in the days that followed the surgery in December.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He continued, “They would come in three days and then the next siblings would come in for the next three days, and then the next siblings,” he recalled. “My dad showing up the day it all happened, flying from Utah. They really showed up in a really beautiful way.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Derek added that Julianne, who re-joined&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>DWTS&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>as a co-host last season, was particularly helpful to the couple during the difficult time. He noted that she flew to Washington, D.C., and stayed for “two weeks” to help. “It was just amazing,” Derek added.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Derek-Hough-and-Hayley-Erbert.png alt="Derek Hough and Hayley Erbert" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Erbert’s family was also there during the difficult time, as well as their close family and friends. The couple also received an outpour of support from the public. “The thing that really makes us — and really her — the most emotional about all of this is just the love that she felt from not just family and friends, but just from everyone. It’s a really beautiful feeling and we’re just really thankful for that,” he continued.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Derek and Erbert&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>tied the knot just months</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;before in August 2023. They wed in Monterey County, California, in front of 106 guests surrounded by trees and plants. “We’re in a redwood forest, but we got married right in front of this mother tree that’s surrounded by all these smaller trees,” Erbert told&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span data-preserver-spaces=true>People</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;at the time. “They drop all the seeds, and it plants kind of like an army of children to protect the mother. The symbolism of it was beautiful. We’re here, planting our seeds to grow our family.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hough recently paid tribute to his wife on the stage of the 2024 Creative Arts Emmy Awards. While accepting his Emmy, he dedicated the win to Erbert. “Exactly a month ago I was in the hospital. this is a different moment,” Derek said tearfully. “A life-changing moment reminded me to really savor each every moment.” He continued: “I want to dedicate this to my beautiful wife … I just flew in from Washington, D.C., last night. Your strength and your courage this whole month has been unbelievable. You inspired me every day.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Following the ceremony, Hough celebrated his win with a&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span data-preserver-spaces=true>lengthy tribute</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;on Instagram and gave Erbert another shout-out, writing: “To my wife, @hayley.erbert this one’s for you. The center piece and muse of this dance. This journey, these moments, they are all the more precious because of what we’ve endured together.”</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For more on Dancing With the Stars, check out our gallery&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>below to find out what these ex-professional dancers are doing now</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYmV9d32OnZyrnZtitbDBxqFko62cnq6vusRmqq6ooKS%2FtXs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fderek-hough-julianne-support.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fderek-hough-julianne-support.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fderek-hough-julianne-support.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fderek-hough-julianne-support.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fderek-hough-julianne-support.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fderek-hough-julianne-support.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jason-kelce-is-humbled-travis-kelce-christmas-duet-debuted-in-top-10.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jason-kelce-is-humbled-travis-kelce-christmas-duet-debuted-in-top-10.html>Jason Kelce Is Humbled Travis Kelce Christmas Duet Debuted in Top 10</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1443589-dakota-kai-aligns-with-bayley-on-2-9-wwe-smackdown.html>Dakota Kai Aligns With Bayley On 2/9 WWE SmackDown</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1443589-dakota-kai-aligns-with-bayley-on-2-9-wwe-smackdown.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
