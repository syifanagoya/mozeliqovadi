A: There are hundreds of members of the salvia family, but only a handful of them are edible, according to traditional medicine. Salvias grown for their ornamental value, such as ‘May Night,’ tricolour salvia, and annual salvia, are not edible.
Is it true that black and blue salvia are harmful in this regard? It’s not the salvias that we cultivate in our gardens, to be honest. Even though they’re deemed non-toxic, some dogs (and humans, for that matter) may have an allergic response or get ill if they consume a large amount of the leaves.</p><footer><a href=../../is-black-and-blue-salvia-edible-html.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../mayhill-hotel-lekki-phase-2-nigeria.html>Mayhill Hotel, Lekki phase 2, Nigeria</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>
