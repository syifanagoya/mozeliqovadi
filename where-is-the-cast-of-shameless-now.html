The dramedy follows the chaotic and troubled Gallagher family as they try to make ends meet on the South Side of Chicago. The patriarch of the family, Frank, is an alcoholic who spends most of his time drinking at the local pub. His kids, meanwhile, are left to fend for themselves and navigate life without the guidance of a parent who truly cares for them. Watching them use their street smarts to make ends meet is nothing if not entertaining, and at the end of the day, many of their struggles are ones we can all relate to.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>Shameless aired from 2011 to 2021 and is now officially over, but we’ll never stop loving it.

As he told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Film Inquiry</a>, “In the case of Shameless, it’s never ending. Lip’s always growing, as I’m growing. His decision making is always changing.

Some of his movies include Mall, The Giver, Vampire Academy, and The Year of Spectacular Men. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nerds of Color</a>, Monaghan opened up about the end of this incredible show:</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>“Things are difficult in general, but I feel like, especially with a show like Shameless, which is a show about a slice of life and sort of how existence doesn’t really fall into a perfect narrative; it tends to be messy and kind of just continue in spite of itself, and it’s a stream of those little victories and these constant mistakes. So you can’t really cap off of a pure ending to a story like that,” the actor said.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>It’s true that watching Shameless come to an end was difficult.

According to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> E-News</a>, she described the on-set relationship saying, “I was obviously a lot younger. There were times when she would try to be a good influence and then there were times where she would be blatantly giving me bad… not the best advice.” Kenney also spoke about a sense of competition she felt on set with Rossum, saying, “I don’t know if it was other people on set creating that or if it was her creating that, but I know I wasn’t creating it.” It doesn’t seem like the two ladies of Shameless are on the best of terms these days, even though they spent so many years playing sisters on camera.</p><h3 id=ethan-cutkosky data-injectable=false>Ethan Cutkosky</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.instagram.com/p/CZP1wYGPo9v/</figure><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>Ethan Cutkosky played the role of Carl Gallagher on Shameless.
